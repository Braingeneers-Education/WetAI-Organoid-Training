This homework will explain the way you will be interfacing with your organoid along with a simulated environment to test your code before pitching your experiment. You will also be given the tools needed to analyze the data produced by your experiment. Then, in the exercises, your group will construct the experiment, with a hypothesis and expectations. After the experiment is over, your final project will be to analyze the results of your experiment. The data that you'll receive back to analyze will be in the same format as the dataset used in this notebook.

Sending a stim pulse at a specific frequency could be read by a neuron in the organoid and that frequency would hold the imformation we'd want to send it. For example, using the cart-pole excerise we did last homework, we could take an angle between [-14, 14] degrees and convert it to stimulations at a rate between [0,10] Hz to a single neuron\n",
